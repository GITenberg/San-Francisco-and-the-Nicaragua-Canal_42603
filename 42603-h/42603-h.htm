<h1>SAN FRANCISCO<br/>
<small>AND</small><br/>
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.</h1>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Legation of the United States of America,<br/>
San Jose, Costa Rica, Central America</span>,<br/>
September 15, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. George C. Perkins</span>,<br/>
United States Senator,<br/>
San Francisco, California.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Your valued favor of August 23d requests me to contest
the argument of a mutual friend entitled to our
personal esteem, in regard to the Nicaragua Canal, to
the construction of which he objects. The admission
made by him that <i>his argument is not made on very broad
lines</i> would indispose me to reply, as the Nicaragua Canal
is a national undertaking, not to be considered from a
narrow standpoint. But, confident that even his narrow
premises will not stand impartial investigation, I
shall contest his arguments first from his restricted platform,
and subsequently in the brief manner necessitated
by the limits of this paper, on a broader and more
patriotic basis.</p>

<p class="indent">In examining his statement of navigable distances I
note some serious errors, consequently you will find
herewith a statement thereof for which I can vouch as
emanating from the United States Hydrographic office.
During my Central American residence I have visited
various United States naval ships on this station and
have found one naval lieutenant opposed to the canal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
On urging him to candidly state his reason for this
opposition, he at first stated that his reason was a personal
one and like our friend&#39;s <i>not made on very broad lines</i>.
He finally admitted that he opposed a canal because if
we do not have one we shall need two navies, one on
each side of the Continent; more naval officers would be
necessary and his promotion would ensue much more
rapidly! Although at first surprised at this view of the
case I thanked him for his friendly candor, and replied
that his argument as a <i>personal</i> one was on a sound basis,
much more so than the railway magnates who oppose the
Canal on the erroneous ground that their overland railways
will be injured thereby when I challenge anyone
to cite an instance where any canal has not benefited
the railways nearest thereto: notably the St. Mary&#39;s and
Erie Canals in our own country.</p>

<p class="indent">Our friend starts with the assumption that the canal
is <i>to be constructed for the purpose of making money</i>. This
I deny <i>in toto</i>. The United States Government will
build a canal on a broader and more beneficent basis, for
the <i>political</i> and <i>military safety</i> of our country, for the
<i>development of its commerce and industries</i> and to secure
a <i>short cheap water</i> route to and from our Pacific Ocean
possessions. The Suez Canal which cost ninety-four
millions was built to make money and earns 17 to 20
per cent. annually on a toll of about $1.85 per ton,
whereas our Government should not charge over one
dollar per ton when the Nicaragua Canal is opened and
when its traffic increases, probably half a dollar per ton
will pay cost of maintenance and leave a small percentage
for a sinking fund.</p>

<p class="indent">Secondly, he states &quot;the Canal will have no business
when first opened.&quot; Why not? Will freight continue
to prefer ten thousand miles greater distance around
Cape Horn or higher Panama Railway Route and overland
railway charges? The business of the Canal will
come from new interests which it will develop and from
other routes which cannot compete with it in rates.
Third. He asserts that it will cost no less than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
$150,000,000.00. How much the Canal will cost depends
upon its capacity and its honest construction.
Since the Maritime Canal Company figured on $80,084,176.00
for a 28-feet canal, the majority report of the
United States Commission has increased the <i>possible</i> cost,
including a 20 per cent. contingency to $118,113,790 for
a canal two feet deeper and much wider, with duplicate
locks of increased size. But experts who have investigated
the question have no fear of financial results even
at the cost of one hundred and fifty millions.</p>

<p class="indent">Fourth. I deny that it will <i>be much more expensive to
operate than the Suez Canal</i>, which needs constant dredging
to keep it from filling with desert sands, as against
the nominal cost of operating modern locks at Nicaragua,
proof of which we have in the cost of lockage at the
Saint Mary&#39;s Canal, which now passes through its locks
nearly three times the tonnage that uses the Suez Canal.
Neither is there apprehension of difficulty in water control
at Nicaragua. Nature has provided against this as
any canal engineer who has examined the route can
prove. <i>An abundance of fresh water under absolute control</i>
is the <i>striking advantage</i> developed at Nicaragua, as
against the Suez Canal built through an irreclaimable
sand desert, constantly encroaching upon it and necessitating
constant dredging. But I may remark that the
Suez canal with an expensive staff expends only 8-1/2 per
cent. of gross receipts for management while the cheapest
and most efficient railway in the United States uses
47 per cent. of gross receipts for operating expenses, and
many of our railways between 50 and 60 per cent. This
is one of several reasons why a canal can afford to carry
cheaper than any railway; it has practically <i>no wear and
tear</i>, and <i>no depreciation</i> to contend with.</p>

<p class="indent">Examining carefully the animus of the paper I find
only two main points to contest. First: The Nicaragua
Canal will divert commerce from San Francisco and other
Pacific Coast Ports. Second: It is &quot;outrageous and
inexcusable&quot; that the Government shall create a competing
route which will injure railways overland which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
it has already aided in construction. Having reasoned
from a fallacious standpoint the conclusions are without
foundation and the last one entirely regardless of the
national and public interest. That the Nicaragua Canal
will divert maritime commerce from San Francisco and
other Pacific Coast Ports is a <i>fallacy</i> based upon the
proposition that, with the advantage of five thousand
miles navigation and canal toll in their favor the merchants
of Pacific Coast Ports will be unable to compete
with their Atlantic Coast and European rivals. Such
proposition implies an <i>incompetency</i> which I am not
disposed to admit. It is a fallacy for another reason
connected with navigation. A steamship from Hong
Kong to Western terminus of Nicaragua Canal, and vice
versa, only increases her distance by calling at San
Francisco <i>twenty</i> miles: from Yokohama <i>ninety-one</i>
miles. The steam route from Yokohama to Brito
(Western terminus of Canal) via Honolulu (practically
on rhumb line) is <i>374 miles longer</i> and from Hong Kong
<i>367 miles longer</i>. These two most important ports illustrate
the same fact as applicable to all other Asiatic
Ports within the distance attraction of the Canal, the
<i>divisional line</i> of which from the United States Atlantic
Coast is at <i>Singapore</i>. The carriage of fuel being a serious
factor in steamship expense, and San Francisco being
practically <i>a half-way port</i> on a run of over ten thousand
miles it <i>must</i> become a port of call for coal and freight,
for all steamships in the Atlantic Asiatic trade, unless
such special limited business offers at Hawaii as will induce
them to navigate nearly four hundred miles additional.
Under these conditions these steamships will
often handle California freight to be discharged and replaced
with a <i>second</i> freight for the Atlantic or for
Asiatic Ports while coaling. The increased tonnage
using Pacific Coast Ports for this reason will cheapen
freights and add greatly to the business of its Ports. It
cannot be claimed that steamers will prefer the longest
route. Even between New York and Europe, where
the shortest (or &quot;great circle&quot; route) infringes upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
Cape Race, the transatlantic steamers run that dangerous,
foggy and iceberg line, in preference to the
longer <i>rhumb line</i> further south, to save a much less
distance, and they will certainly do so on the Pacific
where the saving is much greater. I beg attention to
the subjoined third table of distances of proving the assertions
above made.</p>

<p class="indent">That the canal will <i>divert</i> some overland traffic from
the railways is an indisputable fact. There must be a
new adjustment of conditions. But there will arise
with this adjustment a full compensation which will
soon become <i>vastly more important</i> than the long haul
overland of a class of freights which are only carried
overland to avoid the 15,000 miles Cape Horn route.
In the increased, vastly more profitable <i>short haul</i> to and
from Pacific Coast tide water and in the increased passenger
travel consequent upon the rapid development of
the Pacific Coast our overland railways will find full
compensation&mdash;the Canal will be of great benefit to
them. When the short and cheap water way is available,
European shipping to Pacific Ports will be largely
steam freight tonnage. These steamers will load holds
with English cargo and between decks with immigrants,
and the Pacific Coast will rapidly settle up with these to
the exclusion of Chinese. To such desirable emigration
the Pacific Coast will for the first time be accessible
at reasonable rates. At present the few that have the
means to start for the Coast by overland railways are
induced to settle in the middle West, and consequently
Pacific Coast population increases very slowly. The
same freight steamships will then return to Atlantic
Ports, with Pacific Coast products: Cape Horn will become
a memory.</p>

<p class="indent">The United States Government has covered into its
Treasury approximately $113,000,000.00 which it loaned
the overland railways; the enormous land grants they
keep. What &quot;injustice or outrage&quot; is there in <i>again</i>
using this money to build another transportation route,
national in character, for the benefit of all the Republic?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
This is not even taxation of our people: they have
been once taxed to build the overland railways. I have
in mind an instance where 1,500 barrels provisions were
shipped from Sioux City, Iowa, to Jersey City, lightered
to the California bound ship in East River, New York;
carried 15,000 miles around Cape Horn, paying rail
freight Eastward, lighterage, Cape Horn freight, insurance,
six months interest and San Francisco wharfage;
after all these charges saving <i>one third on the rail freight</i>
westward from Sioux City to the Pacific. Freight rates
eastward on Pacific Coast perishable products are even
higher. You are aware that, to save the onerous westward
freight charges by rail, California merchants have
repeatedly shipped heavy goods by steam from our Atlantic
Ports to Antwerp: thence reshipped via Cape
Horn to San Francisco, paying charges before named,
and would be now doing so save for Customs regulations
forbidding it. It cannot be expected that freight can
be carried by rail across the continent more than three
thousand miles over two mountain chains and compete
in cost with water transportation which under conditions
most favorable to rail transportation costs only one-fifth,
while, with heavy grades, the ratio is one by
water to fifteen by rail. In the effort to control such
freight, the overland railways are <i>preventing the development
of the Pacific Coast</i> to their own detriment and
against the interests of our great country. The day
will come when these railway managers will regard their
opposition to the Canal as error born of <i>unfounded apprehension</i>.
Even now one of the main overland railway
systems is quietly friendly to the Canal. Water
transportation has its limitations, mainly <i>cheapness at
the expense of time</i>. Railway transportation also has its
limitations, mainly <i>speed at increased cost</i>. One is the
complement of the other&mdash;not properly its competitor,
and by carriage of cheap and bulky freight which is
frequently unprofitable to railways on a long haul,
water transportation can and is being used to <i>aid</i> railways.
Even Mr. Huntington frequently shipped his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
railway iron around Cape Horn, as he would have done
through the canal had it been available. While controlling
a railway system from ocean to ocean, he
bought out the &quot;Morgan Steamship Company&quot; between
New York and New Orleans and with the advantage
of this <i>one-third water route</i>, dictated terms to his
railway competitors. Could he have better expressed
his true appreciation of cheap water carriage and of the
inter-oceanic canal?</p>

<p class="indent">The limits of this letter forbid a full discussion of
navigation distances, and besides this, distances are not
fully conclusive. Considerations of traffic, ocean currents,
available coaling stations, and return cargoes
must be taken into account. But I shall briefly allude
to prominent points in connection with navigable distances
which are proven by U. S. Hydrographic Tables.
Considering New York as the starting point, the <i>divisional
line</i> between Suez and Nicaragua Canal influence
in Asiatic commerce is <i>Singapore</i>, which port is only 29
miles nearer New York via Suez than Nicaragua. Consequently
<i>all Asiatic Ports north of Singapore</i> are within
the attraction of the American Canal for United States
commerce. The immense trade of these ports is an important
factor. In Australia, all ports East of and including
Melbourne are much nearer New York than via
Suez. New Zealand, the coasts of North and South
America on both oceans and all Pacific Ocean Island
groups the same. No claim to important diversion
from the Suez Canal can be made, as the distance from
the United States to Port Said protects it. Nor is a
claim to diversion from Suez Canal needed. The Nicaragua
Canal had within its zone of attraction, as shown
by careful estimates in 1890, 8,159,150 tons annually.
The revenue attainable therefrom will depend upon rate
of toll, but at one dollar per ton, with 10 per cent. for
operating expenses (or 1-1/2 per cent. more than at Suez)
it will leave a safe sinking fund even on $150,000,000.00
cost, or, by an extension of time, on a greater amount.
But the earnings will rapidly increase. You will note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
that the Suez Canal merely diverted gradually an <i>ancient</i>
commerce, the increase of which has been steady but
comparatively slow. The Nicaragua Canal can depend
upon an already large commerce, yet in its <i>incipiency</i>.
The resources of the American continent are <i>undeveloped</i>
and its population <i>limited</i>. No man can place a limit
upon the future commerce of this great division of the
habitable world. Another feature in favor of the Nicaragua
Canal is <i>the region through which it will be built</i>.
While its length is 169 miles, it has 121 miles of free
slack water and lake navigation, through a territory of
unsurpassed fertility, blessed with a healthy climate.
Thus, <i>it is not only an inter-oceanic canal but a line of inland
navigation</i> which will so develop the territory on
each side that in a few yew years its commerce will pay
the cost of maintenance. The benefit of a fresh water
canal to ocean carriers of steel or iron will be obvious
to experts: they will leave it with clean bottoms and
boilers filled with fresh water. Its location is 11° North
of the Equator and in the North East trade regions, an
advantage that will enable sailing ships to avail of it.
Cape Horn is twelve hundred miles South of the Cape
of Good Hope and the American Canal consequently
saves greater distances than the Suez or any other canal
that can hereafter be constructed.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>naval</i> and <i>political</i> advantage of the Canal is a
technical question regarding which my opinion is given
with deference. But I find that its opponents are not
found in the Government service. Military and Naval
officers discuss the <i>advisability of fortifying</i> the canal
<i>never doubting its great importance to our country</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Quotations are available to prove that many of our
greatest statesmen have been its ardent advocates, but
space forbids. I may mention among these Grant,
Harrison, Hayes, McKinley and Bryan as well as a
nearly unanimous Senate and House are recorded in its
favor. Are all these great minds dullards on the Canal
question? Are they not the men who <i>ought to understand</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
the great interests of our country, <i>impartially</i> considered?</p>

<p class="indent">As my advocacy for this beneficent work for a quarter
of a century may be regarded as warping my judgment
in its favor, I will end this already too extended reply
by quoting <i>Archibald Ross Colquhoun</i>, an eminent English
Engineer and Government Administrator, who,
having personally examined the Nicaragua Canal route
and the plans adopted for its construction, wrote a
standard work <i>The Key of the Pacific</i> (Longhams, London,
1895) which ends with the following conclusions
(page 335):</p>

<p class="indent">1. It will render greater service to the New World
than the Suez Canal does to the Old.</p>

<p class="indent">2. It will bring Japan, Northern China, Australasia
and part of Malaysia nearer the Atlantic cities of the
United States than they are now to England.</p>

<p class="indent">3. It will benefit America in an infinitely greater
degree than it will Europe, which will only use the
Canal in trading with the Pacific littoral of the two
Americas, the South Sea Islands and possibly New Zealand.</p>

<p class="indent">4. It will divert little or no European traffic from the
Suez Canal.</p>

<p class="indent">5. It will give an immense impulse to United States
manufactures, especially cotton and iron, and will greatly
stimulate the shipbuilding industry and development of
the naval power of the United States.</p>

<p class="indent">6. It will cost more than the estimates show ($80,084,176.00
at that time) but it will have a traffic greater
than is usually admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">7. In the interest of the world it must be neutralized,
and the true policy of the United States is to forward
that end and thus make this international highway a
powerful factor for the preservation of peace.</p>

<p class="indent">To the eminently conservative and disinterested conclusions
of this patriotic English expert, I may be permitted
to give my adherence no less than to the publicly
expressed opinions of the great American statesmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
whose names I have mentioned and to the practically
unanimous approval of the Congress of the United
States, after having actively discussed the Canal question
for twenty years.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
